## Problem Statement
The SECâ€™s EDGAR database contains terabytes of documents and data, including press releases,
annual corporate filings, executive employment agreements, and investment company
holdings. While EDGAR has existed for over twenty years, scholars have had difficulty
conducting or reproducing research based on EDGAR data. Researchers often spend a lot of
time and money developing and redeveloping code to retrieve and parse EDGAR data with no
common bottom-up framework.
